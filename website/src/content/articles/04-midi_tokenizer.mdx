import { MiniRepl } from '../../docs/MiniRepl';

A standalone Java 21 CLI application for parsing Standard MIDI Files (SMF types 0 and 1) and converting them to:
- **LLM-friendly JSON representation** for analysis and processing
- **Strudel live coding patterns** for creative musical exploration

<MiniRepl client:idle tune={`note("a3 c#4 e4 a4")`} />
