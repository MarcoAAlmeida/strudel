import { YouTube } from '@astro-community/astro-embed-youtube';


Youtube algorithm suggested me a video of a live code session using Strudel, and I just loved it.

I forked the repo to have a better look at the code, and experiment with some patterns of my own.

I´m not a musician, so the learning curve is steep, but I´m enjoying the ride!
