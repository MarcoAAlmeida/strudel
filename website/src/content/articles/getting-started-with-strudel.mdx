Strudel is a powerful live coding pattern language for creating music in your browser. This article will introduce you to the basics of Strudel and get you making sounds in no time.

## What is Strudel?

Strudel is a JavaScript port of [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/), bringing the power of algorithmic pattern generation to the web. With Strudel, you can create complex musical patterns using simple, expressive code.

## Your First Pattern

Let's start with a simple drum pattern:

```javascript
sound("bd sd bd sd")
```

This pattern plays a kick drum (bd) and snare drum (sd) in alternation. Try it in the [Strudel REPL](/repl)!

## Working with Notes

You can also create melodic patterns:

```javascript
note("c3 e3 g3 c4").sound("piano")
```

This plays a C major arpeggio using a piano sound.

## Pattern Transformations

Strudel's real power comes from pattern transformations. You can manipulate patterns in many ways:

```javascript
note("c3 e3 g3 c4")
  .sound("piano")
  .fast(2)
  .rev()
```

This pattern plays twice as fast (`.fast(2)`) and in reverse (`.rev()`).
